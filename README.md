# Dotfiles

Configuration files and various scripts for my laptop.

## Core components

- [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3#readme) - my window manager of choice
- [eventd](https://github.com/sardemff7/eventd#readme) - notifications from the system, or [on-demand](https://github.com/p3lim/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/eventd/scripts/popup_all), through a lot of [scripts](https://github.com/p3lim/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/eventd/scripts)
- [Rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi#readme) - system interactivity through [custom scripts](https://github.com/p3lim/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/rofi/scripts)
- [Termite](https://github.com/thestinger/termite#readme) - terminal emulator of choice, very modern and easy to configure
- [Bash](https://github.com/gitGNU/gnu_bash#readme) - the shell, I like to keep things simple
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - with a lot of plugins, it's where I spend way too much time

### Fonts

- [Proggy Clean (Slashed Zero)](http://upperbounds.net/) - I really like monospaced bitmap fonts.
- [Siji](https://github.com/stark/siji#readme) - for additional glyphs, mostly used in the notifications.

## Installation

I highly do **not** recommend attempting to run the install script included, but rather picking out the parts you'd like to use.
